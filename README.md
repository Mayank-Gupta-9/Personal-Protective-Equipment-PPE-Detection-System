# Personal-Protective-Equipment-PPE-Detection-System
This project implements a real-time Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It processes video input to identify whether individuals are wearing essential safety gear such as hard hats, masks, and safety vests.

Key Features:

Utilizes YOLOv8 for fast and accurate detection of PPE and other safety-related items.

Processes video streams with OpenCV, displaying detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

Color-coded alerts highlight missing PPE items (red) or correctly worn equipment (green), enhancing safety monitoring.

Includes a customizable list of detected objects and integrates cvzone for enhanced visual display.

Technologies: Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, cvzone, computer vision.
